					<h3>Second Section</h3>
					<p>Ice Cream is the most delicious of all, because adulte and children can eat during the summer or winter.</p>
					
					<p>They melt in your mouth with creamy soft milk with alot of different flavor.</p>

					<p>I prefered the chocolat flavor, because I loved chocolat and you add some toping that will increased the flavored.</p>

					<p>There are good treat for the summer and it is refreching during the hot summer heat.</p>

					<p>The downside about them they will melt fast during a really hot summer heat, so it's better to eat them fast.</p>

					<p>The best Ice Cream is the Chocolate Sundae with Strawberry best flavored.</p>
