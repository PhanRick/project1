				<h3>First Section</h3>
					<p>My first hobby is Like to play and collect video game.</p>
					
					<p>The first time I touched and play video is was when I was a child and playing Power Ranger on the Super Nintendo it was a hard and it ws fun.</p>

					<p>Then I watched my uncle play a lot of game on the Sony Playstation and I ask my parent if I can have one and thay said no sad.</p>

					<p>I usally play any type of game beside sport since I can do that in real life, but mainly I play Role playing game or Japaness Role Playing Game because I like to level up my character and be overpower.</p>

					<p>Also some video game had a fealing of watching a movie when the story is good with good animation, graphic and sound.</p>

					<p>Also playing is a good way of making stress stop and have a good time with some friend with a party game.</p>

					<h3>Second Section</h3>
					<p>My second hobby I like to watched anime and collect Anime figurine.</p>
					
					<p>The first Anime I watched was Dragon-Ball Z and it got me into it with the fighting the character.</p>

					<p>Then I stared watching Pokemon and it got me start it to buy there Game and product I have no regret doing so.</p>

					<p>I started collecting figurine when I first bought a limited eddition game thta came with figurine I really like toy figure character I start to buy more during a convention or on a lower price, because they are really expensive.</p>

					<p>I prefered to watched the Shonen Jump genre of the Anime like One Piecce or Dragon-Ball because they have action scene in it and they have good comedy moment that make you laugh.</p>

					<p>I also watched different genre if they are good because sometime is a to cliche that main character doing something that are so stupid to screw uo the scene.</p>

					<h3>Third Section</h3>
					<p>My third Hobby I like reading Mange and Light-Novel, I read them when I have nothing else to do or on a bus or metro while waiting to go to my destination.</p>
					
					<p>I like to read manga is because they have really good art drawing and they don't censored any scene when they draw or put any black spot on scene to see people guts and blood.</p>

					<p>The worst part about reading mange or light-novel is waiting for a update and they alway end in a good part where sometinhg is going to good, usally they will come out in a week or month.</p>

					<p>Alos it keep you do to date with anime like if you talk someone who watched the same anime as you and he think know it all you can alway spoiler him the part to screw him over if you don't like the person.</p>

					<p>Is good for pass time for if you want to relaxed and just read some mange or light-novel. </p>

					<p>There are a lot different genre to read but I mostly read Shonen Jump because of One piece.</p>
